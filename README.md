# overmortal-libpython
Old Python Django libraries for abstracted components and utilities

This library code was extracted from a Django CMS/blog application written circa 2009.
Some of the code was modified from examples elsewhere. Credit is given where known.

This code could theoretically be plugged into a Django project as a library, but is primary here as an example of past work.
